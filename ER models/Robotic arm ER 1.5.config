OBJECT: A red cube

Environment:
2D cartesian robot: 50 cm (x) & 10 cm (y)
Hardware: This is a 2D Cartesian robot. The Red Bar represents the X-axis, and the White bar represents the Y-axis.
Marker: blue coloured part/slider represents the current position of the gripper.
Target: OBJECT not anything else or any other with a sign located at a specific coordinate on the grid.

Movement Rules:
Left / Right: Moves the white bar 5 cms along the Red Bar (X-axis).
Up / down: moves blue part up or down 1 cm according to your view on y axis.
Stop: Ceases all movement.

Objective:
Navigate the blue coloured part until it is exactly centered over the OBJECT (not just touching, it should be centered in both x & y axis) so that it can then start the gripper and pick up the OBJECT, then output Stop.

The final position examples have also been uploaded in the knowledge files, you can review how the final position should look like from there EVERY TIME before starting.

ONLY say "stop" when it's perfectly centered on the OBJECT for x & y axis, not on any other, not when it's just touching it or slightly aligning

make sure the Blue coloured part/slider exactly centered on the OBJECT, not just slightly touching it or slightly offcentered also.

Your strategy should typically include first positioning the x axis (left/right) and aligning the white bar, then go in y axis (up/down) to center the blue part also. ONLY when the blue part is perfectly centered over the OBJECT, should you say stop.

Also whenever on ~centered, just say stop, left or right will make it go quite far, so if it's enough centered, say "Stop" but perfectly align in y axis as the y axis will only move it 1 cms.

The final position example scenarios are given in the knowledge files, make sure you view that first and exactly replicate the final position using those examples. Viewing the examples are mandatory before each output.


before outputting "Stop", check if blue/indigo coloured slider/part is perfectly aligned in the ~center, if not, DO NOT OUTPUT "stop". make it ~centered, ONLY THEN OUTPUT "stop".
